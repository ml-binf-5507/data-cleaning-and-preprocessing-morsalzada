# AI Usage Disclosure

**Please include this with your submission.**

## What is Appropriate AI Use? ✅

We encourage you to use AI tools for:
- **Explanations**: "What is one-hot encoding?" or "Explain data leakage"
- **Debugging**: "Why doesn't this code work?" + error message
- **Syntax help**: "How do I use pd.get_dummies()?"
- **Learning resources**: "Recommend a tutorial on standardization"
- **General concepts**: "What's the difference between mean and median?"

## What is NOT Appropriate? ❌

Do NOT:
- Ask AI to write your entire function for you
- Copy code from AI without understanding it
- Submit code without testing/modifying it
- Hide the fact that you used AI
- Use AI to do the assignment for you

## Why This Matters

- **Honesty helps you**: Complete and honest disclosure is viewed positively
- **We care about learning**: If you used AI appropriately, that's fine
- **Understanding is key**: We need to know you actually learned the concepts
- **Dishonesty is serious**: Hiding AI usage or submitting others' work is academic misconduct

## Questions?

If you're unsure whether your AI usage was appropriate, **ask your instructor before submitting**. We'd rather help you understand the guidelines than penalize you later.
